* =folded-by-default-mode=

A minor mode to open files with function (or method) bodies folded by default. Inspired by [[https://matklad.github.io/2024/10/14/missing-ide-feature.html][@matklad's blog post]].

** Help sought!

This has only rudimentary tests, run by loading sample files from GitHub from open-source projects in each of a dozen popular languages (see =test/= directory). I am not an expert in each of these languages, and do not know what is idiomatic -- if I have missed common patterns, please let me know!

Currently, this only implements code folding using =tree-sitter-mode= from MELPA.

There are lots of *TODO* comments left in the code, too ;-)

* Installation

With [[https://github.com/doomemacs/doomemacs][Doom Emacs]]:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(package! folded-by-default-mode :recipe (:host github :repo "necaris/folded-by-default-mode"))
#+end_src

Using [[https://github.com/radian-software/straight.el][=straight.el=]]:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(straight-use-package
  '(folded-by-default-mode :host github
                           :repo "necaris/folded-by-default-mode"
                           :branch "main"))
#+end_src

* Usage

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package! folded-by-default-mode
  :defer t
  :config
  (setq-default global-folded-by-default-mode t))
#+end_src

* Next Steps

- [ ] Publish to MELPA
- [0/2] Implement alternative methods:
  - [ ] Emacs 29+ native =treesit=
  - [ ] hideshow
  - [ ] outline
- [ ] Port to [[https://helix-editor.com][Helix]]?
